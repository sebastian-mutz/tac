Version History
---------------

The course is forked from the open-access, open-source teaching package INTEGRATE (*INTEGRation of Atmospheric science, Technical and Empirical methods*), which was supported by the EGU Higher Education Teaching Grant 2020 and based on a workshop and lecture series taught by Sebastian G. Mutz at the University of Tübingen. Note that the exercises in the P1 and P2 series are based on the ClimStat exercise series developed as part of the University of Tübingen geoscience module "Climate Dynamics, Probability and Statistics". It is therefore credited as version 0.9.
