General Information
===================

This page contains general information for the course "EARTH5019: Theoretical and Applied Climatology", offered at the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow.


Short Description
-----------------
The course provides an introduction to fundamental aspects of theoretical and applied climatology. It explores the theoretical foundations of climate science, such as celestial mechanics, first-order energy fluxes, heat and mass transport in the atmosphere, structural aspects of Earth’s climate system, rain formation, and climate change of the past, present and future. This is complemented by an introduction to important principles in applied climatology, including statistics, probability theory, empirical analysis, and modern mathematical modelling. Finally, a hands-on exploration of fundamental coding practices, and the application of some of the above-mentioned principles, will prepare the students to work with climate datasets on contemporary climate-related problems in a modern research and industry work setting.

**Intro:** *Ahoy*, *servus* and welcome to the course! I'll be your instructor for this module. I am a senior lecturer (associate professor) and climate scientist. I study the interactions between climate and Earth surface systems using process-based and empirical models. This means a spend a lot of time developing and applying methods and models based on atmospheric physics or techniques from machine learning/artificial intelligence. I've been teaching climatology, statistics and programming for quite a few years now, so I hope can help you learn about these topics.

**Support:** Should you have any questions, queries or concerns, feel free to e-mail me and I will try to respond within 24 hours (outside of weekends). If you don’t hear back within a few days, please send your email through again. We  can also chat during/around classes or arrange a separate (in-person or online) meeting if the need arises.
  

Software for this Course
------------------------

There are only a few software libraries required for the completion of this course:

* `Python 3.8 or newer <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
* Python packages `NumPy <https://numpy.org/install/>`_ and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html>`_
* `Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org/download/>`_ (as part of `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ or as a standalone)

Spyder, an IDE (integrated development environment), will be used to write and execute Python code. All exercises, data analysis and group projects can be completed here. All software is downloadable for free. Students should make sure that they have these requirements installed on their computers at the start of the course. If students do not have their own computer, university computers can be provided for the course. Please let the lecturer know in advance.

Note that it is not a requirement that students use the above-mentioned tools for the completion of the exercises. Students may choose to use a different IDE or even a programming language, such as `modern Fortran <https://fortran-lang.org/>`_. However, this ought to be discussed with the lecturer at the beginning of the semester to assess that possibility with regards to student support and group projects.


Resources
---------

* Lecture and lab materials will be made available (or linked) on the "EARTH5019: Theoretical and Applied Climatology" Moodle page for this year.
* The `Python website <https://www.python.org/doc/>`_ includes beginner’s guides that can complement your general introduction to programming in the lab sessions. If you consider using modern Fortran instead, you can use the `LFortran web interface <https://dev.lfortran.org/>`_ to experiment with Fortran conveniently in your web browser.
